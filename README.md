# krypton
krypton is a neat little tabbed proxy which utilises gn math's game library (check out their github: https://github.com/gn-math) - the proxy technology it uses is Scramjet by MercuryWorkshop, and a modified version of Ultraviolet by https://github.com/rhenryw/UV-Static-2.0 and TitaniumNetwork.

I hope you like the project! The demo is at: https://krypton-tau.vercel.app/
